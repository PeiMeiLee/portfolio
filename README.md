# About Me
Hello! I'm Pei-Mei, originally from Taiwan and currently calling Germany home. Spending most of my adulthood working and living abroad, I am no stranger  to cross-cultural communication and cooperation. As a Data Analyst with a background in the automotive sector, I bring fluency in German, English, and Chinese to the table.
I've successfully established data-driven processes and transformed insights into effective marketing strategies during my tenure at an NPO. And I can't wait to solve bigger problems and find greater insights in my next role.
